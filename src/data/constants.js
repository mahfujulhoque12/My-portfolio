This project represents a deep dive into modern full-stack development, featuring a public homepage for browsing properties for rent or sale, and full CRUD functionality that allows authenticated users to post, update, and delete their own listings and project showcases. I implemented a secure authentication system using JWT and bcrypt, integrated with Google Auth via Firebase for a seamless user experience.The application was built with a powerful tech stack, utilizing Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS on the frontend for a type-safe and responsive UI, complemented by the shadcn/ui component library. State management is efficiently handled with Redux Toolkit, while the backend is powered by a custom Express.js server with Node.js and MongoDB for data storage. Tackling the challenges of secure auth flows and seamless full-stack architecture was incredibly rewarding, and this project solidifies my grasp of the entire development lifecycle.
